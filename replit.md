# MWECAU Digital Voting System

## Overview

The MWECAU Digital Voting System is a comprehensive online platform for managing student elections at Mwenge Catholic University. The system has been converted to a lean Django server-rendered app with minimal API endpoints for voting and results.

**Core Purpose:** Enable transparent, secure, and accessible student elections across all MWECAU campuses with instant results and complete audit trails.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-level election management (President, State Leaders, Course Leaders)
- Secure token-based voting system
- Django session-based authentication
- Minimal JSON API for voting submission and results
- Server-rendered UI with Django templates

## Recent Changes

**November 14, 2025 - Lean UI Conversion Complete**

**Major Refactor - API-First to Server-Rendered:**
- Removed heavy dependencies: JWT authentication, CORS headers, Swagger documentation
- Simplified REST framework configuration to Session authentication only
- Converted to Django session-based authentication (login, logout, register)
- Created function-based views for UI (replacing class-based API views)
- Built simple HTML templates without styling (login, register, dashboard, home)
- Kept only 2 minimal API endpoints:
  - POST /api/election/{election_id}/submit/ - Submit vote with voter token
  - GET /api/election/{election_id}/results/ - Retrieve election results (JSON)

**Updated Dependencies:**
- Removed: djangorestframework-simplejwt, django-cors-headers, drf-yasg, mysqlclient
- Kept minimal: Django 5.2.8, DRF (for API endpoints only), Pillow, psycopg2-binary
- Added: gunicorn (for production deployment)

**Configuration Changes:**
- Updated .env.example with minimal configuration
- Simplified settings.py - removed JWT/CORS/Swagger config
- Updated requirements.txt - removed heavy packages
- Clean URLs - removed unused API endpoints

**UI Implementation:**
- Home page: Introduction and navigation to login/register
- Login page: Session-based authentication with registration number and password
- Register page: New user registration with college data validation
- Dashboard: User info, voting tokens, active elections, API endpoint documentation

**November 14, 2025 - Replit Environment Setup**
- Imported project from GitHub
- Installed Python 3.11 and all dependencies
- Configured Django to run on port 5000 with host 0.0.0.0
- Set up SQLite database for development
- Created .env file with Replit-compatible settings
- Configured ALLOWED_HOSTS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for Replit domains
- Ran database migrations successfully
- Collected static files
- Created workflow for automatic server startup
- Server running successfully

**Test Data Available:**
- 6 States
- 14 Courses
- 2 Users (with voting tokens)
- 1 Active Election

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
**Django 5.2.8** - Python web framework with server-rendered templates

**Rationale:** Lean, server-rendered approach reduces frontend complexity and heavy dependencies while maintaining security and functionality.

### Authentication & Authorization
**Django Session Authentication**
- Uses registration numbers instead of usernames for student identification
- Custom `UserManager` and `RegistrationNumberBackend` for authentication
- Django's built-in session authentication for UI
- Session authentication for API endpoints

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- Voter: Standard students who can vote
- Candidate: Students running for positions
- Class Leader: Can upload student data
- Commissioner: Full administrative access

### Database Design
**SQLite** (Development) - File-based relational database
**PostgreSQL/MySQL** (Production-ready via psycopg2-binary)

**Core Data Models:**

1. **User Management:**
   - `User`: Central authentication with voter IDs, registration numbers, roles
   - `CollegeData`: Pre-registration student data for validation
   - `State`: Geographic/administrative divisions
   - `Course`: Academic programs

2. **Election System:**
   - `Election`: Election events with date ranges and active status
   - `ElectionLevel`: Multi-level election hierarchy (President, State, Course)
   - `Position`: Specific roles within elections (with gender restrictions)
   - `Candidate`: User candidacies for positions
   - `VoterToken`: Unique per-user, per-election, per-level voting tokens
   - `Vote`: Anonymized voting records

**Design Pattern:** The system uses a hierarchical election model where elections contain multiple levels (President, State, Course), each level has positions, and positions have candidates.

### API Architecture
**Minimal REST API** - Only for voting and results

**API Endpoints (JSON):**
- POST /api/election/{election_id}/submit/ - Submit vote with voter token in payload
- GET /api/election/{election_id}/results/ - Retrieve election results

**Authentication:**
- Session authentication (must be logged in via UI first)
- Voter token validation in payload for voting endpoint

### Security Features

1. **Vote Anonymity:** Votes are not linked to users in the database
2. **Token-Based Voting:** Unique UUIDs prevent duplicate votes
3. **CSRF Protection:** Enabled for all form submissions
4. **Password Hashing:** Django's built-in secure password hashing
5. **Session Security:** Django's secure session management
6. **Verification System:** Two-step registration with admin verification

### Multi-Level Election System

**Three Election Levels:**
1. **President:** University-wide, all students eligible
2. **State Leader:** State-specific, filtered by student's state
3. **Course Leader:** Course-specific, filtered by student's course

**Eligibility Logic:** Users receive tokens only for levels they're eligible to vote in based on their state and course assignments.

### Frontend Architecture
**Server-Side Rendered Templates** (No CSS/JS frameworks)

**Technology Stack:**
- Django Template Language
- Pure HTML (no styling)
- Function-based views
- Django forms and validation

**URL Structure:**
- / - Home page
- /login/ - Login page
- /register/ - Registration page
- /dashboard/ - User dashboard
- /admin/ - Django admin panel

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages (Minimal)
- **Django 5.2.8** - Web framework
- **djangorestframework** - Minimal REST API (voting & results only)
- **Pillow** - Image processing
- **psycopg2-binary** - PostgreSQL adapter
- **python-dotenv** - Environment variable management
- **requests** - HTTP library
- **gunicorn** - Production WSGI server

### No Frontend Dependencies
- Pure HTML templates
- No CSS frameworks
- No JavaScript libraries
- Server-rendered only

## Replit Environment

### Access Points
- Main Application: Webview (port 5000)
- Home: / (redirects to dashboard if logged in)
- Login: /login/
- Register: /register/
- Dashboard: /dashboard/
- Admin Panel: /admin/
- API: /api/election/{id}/submit/ and /api/election/{id}/results/

### Environment Variables (.env)
Located in `src/.env` with Replit-compatible configuration:
- DEBUG=True
- ALLOWED_HOSTS includes .replit.dev and .repl.co
- CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS configured for Replit domains
- SQLite database configured
- Email console backend for development

### Workflow
- **Django Server**: `cd src && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000`
- Auto-starts on Replit
- Bound to 0.0.0.0:5000 for webview access

### Deployment Configuration
- **Target**: VM (always-on server for stateful election system)
- **Command**: gunicorn with 2 workers
- **Reloadable**: Database migrations and static files collection via Django

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Next Steps

1. Test voter token flow with API endpoints
2. Add more UI pages as needed (election list, voting interface, results display)
3. Consider PostgreSQL migration for production
4. Add email configuration for production notifications
5. Create admin user for testing

# MWECAU Digital Voting System (Club Edition)

A lightweight, HTML-first Django project for student elections. Bootstrap and collected static bundles have been removed to keep the interface plain and easy to extend.

## Quick start (development)
```bash
cd src
cp ../.env.example .env   # demo values only; set real secrets before deploy
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Environment
- All demo environment variables live in `.env.example` (no secrets committed).
- For production, copy `.env.example` and provide real values via your host/secret manager.

## Data
- No sample data or auto-seeding commands are shipped. Add users, courses, and elections manually via the admin UI or your own import tools.

## Stack
- Django with a custom `User` model (see `core` app)
- Django REST Framework with JWT + Session auth
- SQLite for development; use PostgreSQL in production

## Key URLs
- UI: `/`, `/login/`, `/register/`, `/dashboard/`
- Elections: `/elections/`, `/elections/<id>/vote/`, `/elections/<id>/results/`
- Commissioner APIs: `/api/commissioner/stats/`, `/api/commissioner/election/<id>/analytics/`

## Contributing
- Plain HTML/CSS, no Bootstrap. Feel free to style with your own CSS.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

## Notes

- Run `python manage.py collectstatic` in your target environment to generate static assets.
